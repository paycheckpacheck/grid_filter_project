# Grid Filter Project

This project aims to demonstrate a grid filter process using Python. The grid filter process involves filtering data on a grid and can be utilized in various applications such as image processing, signal processing, and data analysis.

## Features
- Implement grid filtering algorithm
- Process and filter data on a grid
- Demonstrate application in data manipulation

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ProjectFolder/grid_filter_project.git
   cd grid_filter_project
   ```

### Example Usage

### fdtd_sim.py
```python
import numpy as np
import fdtd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Import matplotlib for plotting

# Define simulation size (25x25 grid)
grid_size = (25, 25, 1)  # 2D grid in the xy-plane with depth 1

# Initialize the FDTD grid with the defined size
grid = fdtd.Grid(shape=grid_size, grid_spacing=1e-6)  # Grid spacing is 1 micron

# Material properties
# Copper (approximate values at GHz frequencies)
copper_permittivity = 1.0
copper_permeability = 1.0
# FR4
fr4_permittivity = 4.5
fr4_permeability... [Truncated]
```

### main.py
```python
import numpy as np
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def compute_transfer_function(s_params, frequency):
    """
    Compute the transfer function from S-parameters at a given frequency.
    This is a placeholder for the actual computation based on the application.
    """
    # Example: simple gain calculation
    return np.abs(s_params) * np.exp(-1j * frequency)

def spatial_fft(transfer_function, grid_size=(25, 25)):
    """
    Compute the spatial FFT of the transfer function.
    ... [Truncated]
```
