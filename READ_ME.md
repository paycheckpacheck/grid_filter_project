# Grid Filter Project

This project aims to demonstrate a grid filter process using Python. The grid filter process involves filtering data on a grid and can be utilized in various applications such as image processing, signal processing, and data analysis.

## Features
- Implement grid filtering algorithm
- Process and filter data on a grid
- Demonstrate application in data manipulation

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ProjectFolder/grid_filter_project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd grid_filter_project
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

## How to Run
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Usage
Here is a basic example of using the grid filter process in Python:

```python
import grid_filter

# Define the data to be filtered
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Apply the grid filter
filtered_data = grid_filter.grid_filter(data)

print(filtered_data)
```

## Code Highlights

### main.py
```python
import numpy as np
import grid_filter

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
filtered_data = grid_filter.grid_filter(data)

print(filtered_data)
```

### grid_filter.py
```python
import numpy as np

def grid_filter(data):
    data_array = np.array(data)
    filtered_data = data_array * 2  # Example grid filtering operation
    return filtered_data.tolist()
```
