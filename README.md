# Grid Filter Project

This project aims to showcase a grid filtering process using Python. The grid filtering process involves filtering data on a grid and can be applied in various domains such as image processing, signal processing, and data analysis.

## Features
- Implementation of a grid filtering algorithm
- Processing and filtering of data on a grid
- Demonstration of application in data manipulation

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ProjectFolder/grid-filter-project.git
   ```

## Usage
- Explore the `fdtd_sim.py` file for Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulations.
- Check out the `main.py` file for computing transfer functions and spatial FFT.

## Code Highlights
### fdtd_sim.py
```python
import numpy as np
import fdtd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define simulation size
grid_size = (25, 25, 1)

# Initialize the FDTD grid
grid = fdtd.Grid(shape=grid_size, grid_spacing=1e-6)

# Material properties
copper_permittivity = 1.0
copper_permeability = 1.0

# FR4 properties
fr4_permittivity = 4.5
fr4_permeability = 1.0
...
```

### main.py
```python
import numpy as np
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def compute_transfer_function(s_params, frequency):
    """
    Compute the transfer function from S-parameters at a given frequency.
    """
    return np.abs(s_params) * np.exp(-1j * frequency)

def spatial_fft(transfer_function, grid_size=(25, 25)):
    """
    Compute the spatial FFT of the transfer function.
    ...
    """
...
```
