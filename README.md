# Grid Filter Project

The Grid Filter Project is a Python-based initiative that showcases the grid filtering process, enabling users to filter data efficiently on a grid. This project highlights the versatility of grid filtering in various domains such as image processing, signal processing, and data analysis.

## Features

- Implementation of a robust grid filtering algorithm
- Data processing and filtering capabilities on a grid
- Practical demonstration of grid filtering applications in data manipulation

## Installation

To get started with the Grid Filter Project, follow these simple installation steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ProjectFolder/grid_filter_project.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Example Usage

Once you have completed the installation process, you can leverage the project as follows:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Execute the `main.py` script to initiate the grid filtering process.

## Code Highlights

### fdtd_sim.py

The `fdtd_sim.py` script demonstrates a simulation scenario utilizing the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. This snippet includes features like defining simulation size, initializing the FDTD grid, and specifying material properties for copper and FR4.

```python
import numpy as np
import fdtd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define simulation size (25x25 grid)
grid_size = (25, 25, 1)

# Initialize the FDTD grid with the defined size
grid = fdtd.Grid(shape=grid_size, grid_spacing=1e-6)

# Material properties for copper and FR4
copper_permittivity = 1.0
copper_permeability = 1.0

fr4_permittivity = 4.5
fr4_permeability... [Truncated]
```

### main.py

In the `main.py` script, various functionalities like computing transfer functions based on S-parameters and performing spatial Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) are demonstrated. Additionally, this script includes a method for calculating transfer functions at specified frequencies.

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def compute_transfer_function(s_params, frequency):
    """
    Compute the transfer function from S-parameters at a given frequency.
    This is a placeholder for the actual computation based on the application.
    """
    # Example: simple gain calculation
    return np.abs(s_params) * np.exp(-1j * frequency)

def spatial_fft(transfer_function, grid_size=(25, 25)):
    """
    Compute the spatial FFT of the transfer function.
    ... [Truncated]
```
